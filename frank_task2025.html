  <h1>
Frank St. Gardens 2025 Tasks   Anticipated by Season</h1>
---------------------------------------------
<h2><big>Early Spring</big></h2>
<p><b>(“Anytime” Tasks at bottom of this doc)</b></p>
<p>Dates are approx.<br>
If a task doesn’t get done in the week planned, carry over to next & future weeks.</p>

<p><b>If special projects</b> are initiated such as “Hummingbirds” or “Food”  it will change some of these plans and create new tasks,  e.g.  plants may need to be removed, to make space for new plants that are wanted.</p>

<p><b>about March 23— April 12</b> <big> (Cleanup) All Sites</big>  if no snow cover, gradually remove old stalks.  Hollow Stalks: pile in Bed#1 rack ---- Not hollow, dispose in waste bags.</p>

<p><b>March 23–29</b>   (Cleanup) All Sites<br>
<b>March 30—April 5</b>  (Cleanup) All Sites<br>
<b>April 6–12</b> (Cleanup) All Sites</p>

<p><b>???April 6 -- May 1</b>    Sign contract deal with Mr. MacLeod  (O’Connor/Frank) IF we want a new garden here</p>

<p><big>(Create new sign) to identify Electro-Pulse </big>(Pollinator Garden) or (Bee Butterfly Garden)    including  “Volunteer”   and Contact info<br>
Print, Laminate, & Put up the sign when ready.</p>

<p><b>April 13–19 </b>  (Dig out composted soil)
At 306 compost pile, <br>
(1) rake off leaves & pile to the side.<br>
(2) remove old stalks of plants that are sill tough and pile separately.<br>
(3) Dig out all the soil, mixing with leaves and small plant bits,  and make a pile nearby.</p>

<p><b>April 20–26   At 306</b>  put old tough stalks in waste bags, put bags on street for pickup.</p>

<p><big>(Signs) upgrade Garden Signs,</big><br>
-- remove the "Will be Cleaned Up" signs – if  not damaged, save for next year. <br>
-- Stand up fallen garden signs & pollinator data signs, <br>
-- Put up new garden signs & pollinator data signs as needed
(one in each bed, 2 in bed#4</p>

<p><b>Probably April 19 or 20</b>  (Earth Day is 22nd Tuesday)<br>
<big>(Earth Day Table)</big> at Dundonald Park.>/p>


<p><b>April 27—May 3</b>  IF we are doing new MacLeod garden O’Connor/Frank,
<big>Remove Grass</big></p>

<p><b><i>Options to Integrate Dug-up Grass from O’Connor/Frank site</i></b><br>
Bottom layer in raised beds at 295 -- Assuming beds will not have false bottoms  and Assuming total soil depth will be more than 12 inches,   some of the dug-up grass could go upside-down on the bottom layer of raised beds. <br>
Soil above the dug-up grass-layer should be 12” depth to discourage grass from coming through.
<br><br>
In anticipation (we don’t know when raised beds will be built)  dug-up grass could be piled upside down on the lawn of 295 in the same area where raised beds are planned.  Ideally cover with plastic or cardboard until wanted, but not necessary.  Then before we start to build the raised beds, the pile of dug-up grass will have to be moved out of the way while they are being built.
<br><br>

If we get permission, we might  pile some dug-up grass upside down where the compost pile is now, at rear of 306 yard.   However, I told Jessie   that compost pile would be gone in 6 months so it is not supposed to be permanent.  But we could ask. It should only be a low pile.
<br><br>
Otherwise, dug-up grass, after shaking off as much dirt as possible, can be turned upside down at O’Connor/Frank (not piled) and left to dry for 3-7 days, then Either put in MacLeod’s dumpster (have to ask permission) or put in waste bags elsewhere on the street such as 306.  (Bags won’t get picked up on street at MacLeod’s).
</p>


<p><b>May 4–10</b>
<ul>
<li> Assign 2 vols to plan and manage Raised  Beds at 353
</li>
<li> Repair Rasied Beds as needed 
</li>
<li> Request Aaron Walz for soil to add to Raised Beds at 353 
</li>
  <li> Continue Remove Grass tasks as described for April 27—May 3 above.</li>
<li> <b>306</b> piled soil and rotted leaves can be scattered<b> lightly</b> on the pre-planted patches & beds  at 306 and at 295
</li> 
<li> <b>Bed#3 west point</b> ---  Remove Artichokes under west side of Crababble Tree 
NOTE:  What to plant here? Sunflowers may not do well up close to the tree due to too much shade and tree branches 
  creating a ceiling.
</li> 
  <li>

<big>(Prune Crabapple Tree)</big> – on west side,  remove 1 out of 3 branches entirely, cutting them off at the tree trunk.  
  The same can be done to the whole tree, as well as the 2nd tree in Bed#3. 
</li>
</ul>
<p><b><big>Spring Seeds</big></b><br> (dates overlapping with Transplant new plants)</p>
<p><b>May 18–24
&  May 25---31</b><br>
<b> -- Please MARK planted areas with string & marker signs so we know they are there.</b></p>

<p>Seed Suggestions:<br>
*** Scatter clover seeds on 353 Lawn areas, also at 306 and Glad/Lyon on lawns <br>
  
  <b> Forget-Me-Nots  (We have to buy the seeds)</b><br>
*** bed #3  in scatterd spots.  Include Fairy Garden. <br>
*** 353-357 --- 5 or 6 scattered spots<br>
*** 295 --- 2 or more spots in grass (dig out a small spot of grass)<br>
& 3 or 4 spots inside the front bed by sidewalk<br>
*** 306   10 spots, both in cultivated and grass areas<br>
*** Glad/Elgin   a few<br>
*** Glad/Lyon   5 or 6 spots in grass area  (dig out a small spot of grass) <br><br>

???*** _IF_ we start new garden O'Connor/Frank (MacLeod's), a few scattered spots</p>

<p><b>
Calendula</b><br>
<b></i>Note:</i></b>  I have Calendula seeds. However at<b> 295, left of front steps,</b> there will be a million Calendula sprouts  (some of them are overwhelming 2 Prairie Smokes which should be moved somewhere else as soon as they become visible)</p>

<p>Excess Calendula sprouts could be transplanted instead of seeds, and might be wanted for a suggested, <b> Low-Growing Border on East Side of Front Walk at 295.</b><br>
They can also be put in Pots until needed</p>
<p><b>
*** bed#3 NW corner </b> a small patch  (where tall cutleaf coneflower used to be)<br>
<b>maybe –</b> East end of bed#4,  replace the clump of common goldenrod
<br><br>
???*** _IF_ we start new garden O'Connor/Frank (MacLeod's),<br>
a border (12”--18” wide) of thinly scattered Calendula seeds on all 4 sides.</p>
<p><b>
Plant some Calendula seeds in pots,</b> they can be transplanted later when we see a space (or sell or giveaway).</p>
<p><b>
Cosmos<br>
353-357 Centre --- Maybe a few. Do not plant Cosmos in the front side of beds – they get too tall and will hide other plants.</p>

<p>IF MacLeod, a good patch (somewhere near Centre, not on the edges)  <br>
IF/WHEN  new bed at Electro-Pulse<br>
Don’t need new Cosmos seeds in the original 4 beds</p>
<p><b>
Amaranth</b><br>
This annual plant sprouts very small but grows quickly to 24” ht. & 24” width with dramatic big red leaves.
I suggest there could be a clump in<b> bed#3</b> in front of the Wild Bergamot. <br> We have no other place for Amaranth in the 4 original beds. <br>
<b>353-357</b>   I suggest  plant 2 seeds in 2 spots in the central cultivated beds. If the 2 plantings are not together,  try to place them symetrically to the overall yard plan.
<br><br>
???*** _IF_ we start new garden O'Connor/Frank (MacLeod's), plant 2 seeds on each corner, allowing space for them to expand 18 inches around</p>
<p><b>

???295,  </b>not sure we have enough space.  Maybe in the front bed by the sidewalk some of the existing plants could be moved closer together to make space.   <br><br>

<b>Plant a few Amaranth seeds In Pots </b> -- keep for later, or plant sale or giveaway
</p>
<p><big>(Transplant New Plants)</big> – and some “good plants” we want to move<br>
Probable some new plants each week from May 18 -- June 21.  Other new plants may arrive sporadically throughout the season – if we can find a place to put them.
<br><br>
Note:  some plants or seeds already in garden don’t sprout til first week of June  so we may not want to be digging them up in the process </p>
<p>
There’s very little space for new plants in the original 4 beds.  <br>
<b>353-357</b> centre yard can take a number of new plants.<br>
295, not much space. .. <br>
<b>306,</b> we can plant things here, requires digging more grass
IF we are doing new MacLeod garden O’Connor/Frank, a number of plants under 36 inch height can go here<br><br>

IF/WHEN  Electro-Pulse (Glad/Lyon)  we may create a new bed along the wall,  new plants here.
</p>
<p><b>May 11-17</b><big>  (Watering)</big> All Sites may start about now, depends on weather</p>
<p><b>
May 18--24 </b><big>(Transplant)  + (Plant Spring Seeds)</big><br>
<b>May 25–31</b><big> (Transplant) + (Plant Spring Seeds) + (Potting)<br>
<b>June 1–7</b><big> (Transplant)</big></p>

<p><big>Plant Control & </big>Weeding  starts about now. <br>
1.  “Weeds” unwanted – remove --- Burdock, Curly Dock, Evg. Primrose, <br>
2.  Good plants growing in the wrong place – move to a patch of the same,  or Pot, or throw away --- Sunflowers, Milkweed, Cosmos, NE Aster, other Asters, <br>
3.   Plants we want to keep some, , but must be controlled – Creeping Charlie, Dandelion, Vetch,
</p>
>p><b>
Chop throw-away plants </b> into small pieces and use for mulch.</p>
<p><big>
(Potting) =</big> plants to keep for later, for plant sale, or giveaway<br>
<b>Place Potted plants in trays </b>in shade under tree on lawn of 306<br>
<b>Note:  WATER</b> potted plants every 2-3 days  when not raining</p>
<p><b>
June 8–14 </b><big> (Transplant) <br>
(Plant Control/Weeding)   (Potting)<br>
(Remove stalk pile from Bed#1 </big>– put in waste bags on street in front of someone’s house)</p>
<p><b>
June 14--21 </b><big> (Transplant)  (Plant Control/Weeding) (Potting)</big><br>
<b>June 22-28</b>  <big>(Plant Control/Weeding) (Potting)</big><br>

<h3>Ongoing & Anytime tasks 2025</h3>

<p><big><b>
Ongoing Tasks:</b></big></p>

<p><b>* Watering.   all sites,</b><br><br>

For Gburger & Electro-Pulse, would be good for persons who live near those sites.
Gburger needs water more often due to shallow soil depth.</p>
<p><b>
*Pickup Litter</b>    (all sites)<br>
<b>* Stake up</b> fallen plants<br>
<b>* Fallen Signs,</b> Missing Signs – Drive them up  or Replace</p>
<p><b>
*Plant Sales</b><br>
Soon as we get 75 plants in pots,  we may want to have plant sales at corner of Bank.
Potted plants could also be offered for sale at the Herbwalk and other Events.
When a date is set,   a number of volunteers are needed to set it up and staff table.
</p>
<p><big><b>
Anytime Tasks:</b></big></p>

<p><b>* Plant Inventory </b>of all plants in all sites.  Species and location.
Would be great if this can  be charted in a graphic format.  Otherwise just make a list.
</p><p><b>
* Research </b>our Plant List for Butterfly "Host Plants" & note which butterflies
</p><p><b>
* Talk to homeowners/ property owners </b>on Frank Street between O’Connor & Canal, encourage them to plant flowers & offer help if we are prepared to help. We may have potted plants to offer them.
</p><p><b>
* Find a black plastic compost bin </b>-- or build a small nice looking compost bin -- at Bed#3 or 295 or 306

</p><p><b>=* (Art)  Design new Sign(s)</b>  identifying Frank Garden &  contact info</p>
<p><b>
* Attach/mount  metal signs</b></p>
