<h3>Why do you want "local currency" when we already have money for exchange?</h3>
<p>
Hi,<br>
Think outside the box to empower ourselves together
</p>
<p>
<b>Nice Talents! Community Exchange</b>
<br<
"local currency" (NTAL Credits) is Created by the goods and services Members produce with their work. When you, Member A, do 3 hours of housekeeping help for Member B, they pay you (say) 75 Cr. You then use your 75 Cr to buy hair styling from Member C.
</p>

<b>Why do you want local currency when we already have CA$ money for exchange?</b>
</p>

<h4>2 1. economic and 2. community</h4>
<p>
1.  The distribution policy of CA$ money causes "scarcity".  Many people can't get enough money to prosper. 
  You earn $40,000 from your 3 jobs, or from your pension or whatever. But you could really use some housekeeping help, 
  for which you don't have enough CA$ money.
</p>
<p>
Yet you do have talents to do hairstyling on the side.  The Community Exchange brings you a Member who wants your 
  hairstyling talents. And brings you another Member who wants to help you with housekeeping.

<p>2. Community Exchange connects you with people in your community. You meet the housekeeping helper and learn that her brother likes to play hockey. And it just so happens you have a son who likes to play hockey! Connections. It's good to know people.
