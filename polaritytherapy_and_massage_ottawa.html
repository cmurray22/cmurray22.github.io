 <p><b> Not for Profit Activity
 <br>to experience and learn about yourself.</b>
 <br> 2 different experiences I share
 <br>that you will not find anywhere else.
 <br>With deep respect and understanding
 <br>of your comfort, modesty,
 <br>and somatic response to contact
 </p>
 <b>Polarity Therapy</b>,
 <br>to feel and become aware <br>
 of your energy-fields with
 <br>gentle point to point contacts.
 <br>Light clothing, panties or more is okay.
 <br>
 You're covered by a sheet and must be warm.
 </p>
 <p>
 <b>Sensuality Massage,</b>
 <br> to experience new subtle sensations
 <br>of your body consciousness
 <br>and tactile communications
 <br>in a state of relaxation
 </p>
 <p>
 Private sessions for yourself, or
 <br>bring up to 3 trusted female friends
 <br>plus yourself a max of 4.
 <br>Your friend, or friends, help me
 <br>in providing your experience on the table
 <br>and I show them how.
 <br>There are also diagrams for
 <br>some of the polarity therapy contacts.
