       <b> More gardens in central Ottawa!
</b>
Help Environment - beautiful communities - improve mental health
<h3> Central Ottawa Garden Working Group </h3>
Let's talk Gardening!  Whether you're an experienced  gardener, a new gardener, or want to become a gardener!
<p>
We keep in touch by e-mails & meet in person.
<b>
Please join -- send e-mail --  cmurray@proton.me
</b>
<br>
Want to start a chat group or social media page, please do! Does anyone know how to start a "Feed" on Bluesky?
</p>

<p>
1. Sharing experiences, extra plants etc.
<br>
2. Info & advice to start a garden -- seeds & tips for random planting in vacant spots -- asking property owners for permission
<br>
3. Compile a list of all plantings on properties managed by the City;
<br>
submit list to Coucilor's office & City departments annually, asking them not to destroy the plantings.
<br>
(It is not reasonable to expect the City to keep track of all the garden projects!)

<li> <b> Individuals </b> who have a plot or box in Community Food Gardens are welcome in this Working Group! I'm not listing the Community Food Gardens here for now, because JustFood has a list.
</li>

</ul>
<p>
Community Associations are the logical hub.
I've proposed this Working Group be adopted by  Centretown CA's Trees Greenspace Committee, Dalhousie CA's Committee of the Public Realm, and Lowertown CA's Health & Wellness Committee.

<br><br>
Adopting this Working Group does not involve  obligations for the CA's. Would be good if each CA has a representative in this Group.
<br> <br>
All gardeners are encouraged to become members of your local CA.
</p>

Have more fun by working together!
