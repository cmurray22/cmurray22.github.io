<h1> Empowering Ourselves Together with Local Currency Exchange</h1>

<p>
For centuries, people have given away their power to authorities:
King, church, industrial capitalists, dominant technologies, and the banking/money system.
</p>
<p>
Planets in Aquarius and higher frequency galactic energies indicate power shifting to the people -- replacing top-down authority with human-centred, horizontal systems.
</p>
<p>
This evolution is all-encompassing. It includes individual power to choose positive thoughts and emotions for ourselves, re-connecting with the earth, shared well-being for all -- a universal consciousness among humans that leaves behind old divisions.
</p>
<p>
Another example of reclaiming power together are  Community Volunteers who may be primarily focused on social contacts. Humans are social. It's not an option, it's a necessity.  But parents, schools, big tech, city policies to eliminate or commercialize public spaces, and the ideology of money/property have isolated everyone. Reclaiming your power through social activity is very good.
</p>
<p>
Our DIY pollinator gardens are another way of reclaiming power together -- citizen action to save our natural environment and prevent the collapse of civilization.

<h2>currency of exchange</h2>
<p>
Seashells, tea leaves, macaw feathers, and bats' teeth have all been used as money. Money works because people believe in its value.
</p>
<p>
Now, the Bank of Canada creates money  --- seemingly out of nothing, but it's based on the expectation that citizens will produce goods and services.  Goods and services have Real value.
</p>
<p>
We all believe in the value of money. Problem, the way it gets distributed maintains "scarcity". Many people can't get enough money to prosper.
</p>
<p>
Conservative cutbacks are coming, prices will keep going up, and billionaires get most of the money that is created.
</p>
<p>
But any group can create its own currency of exchange among themselves. Often they name their currencies  "Green Dollars"  or "Hamilton Dollars".
</p>
<p>
I didn't want to use "Dollars"  but it might be better than my term "Credits?" What do you think? We could call it anything.  I thought about "Coin" or "Booty" or "Nice Dinero" or "Beans"....
</p>
<p>
Maybe if we get some bats' teeth to exchange, people might be more interested ...?
</p>
<p>
We all want money -- why? To buy something. If we can get the "something" with NTAL credits instead of money, we're good.
</p>
<p>
Though the benefit of local currency is small relative to the total cost of living, it's a way of reclaiming some power over your ability to take part in economic activity. And helping others in the community.
</p>
<p>
What often happens is people get things with credit exchange that they just wouldn't have the money to buy. Like art, or Reiki....
</p>
<p>
As our group grows we will get more items or services that are attractive to people. Food is attractive.
</p>
<p>
BTW Cathy has an idea for a local currency with paper bills to exchange in-person.  Might be a fun way to introduce people to the concept.. And paper may be good for certain circumstances.
</p>
<p>

I just got a herbal consultation from for $60 plus 60 NTAL Credits. She wants housekeeping & garden help. I paid Credits for tech help from a guy in India who's on a community exchange there.
</p>
<p>
There are many persons in Ottawa with tech help ability but how do I find them? Anything you search on the internet are expensive professional services. But I don't need that. I just needed a couple hours of coaching.
</p>
<p>
Many things you need help with on a small scale but you don't know how to find them. Community exchange connects you with those people.
